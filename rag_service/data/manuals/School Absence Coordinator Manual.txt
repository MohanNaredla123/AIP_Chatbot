1. Introduction
   1.1 About AIP  
      The Attendance Improvement Plan (AIP) is an online system that helps New Mexico schools create student attendance plans and action steps to improve them.  
      • Track student‑attendance trends across schools.  
      • Plan evidence‑based strategies to improve attendance.  
      • Monitor progress through reporting periods.

   1.2 Your Responsibilities as School Absence Coordinator  
      ✔ Submit an annual attendance‑improvement plan for your school.  
      ✔ Analyze root causes of chronic absenteeism (e.g., transportation, health).  
      ✔ Develop tiered intervention strategies (Tiers 1 – 4).  
      ✔ Update progress after every reporting period and adjust targets.
